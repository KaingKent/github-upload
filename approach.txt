save memory by putting history in dict trie and added a count variable in each node and save engineering effort by not creating a new data structure since 
the worst case scenario would be that the user history consists of all the same words as the dictionary; that means two data structures would contain the same contents

trade off runtime when program is first run to put user history in dict trie and since user history words are mixed in the dict trie, i have to look at every possible suggestion and take the top 5
i concatenated the uses with the suggestion so that the treeset would auto sort it for me
